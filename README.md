# Complexityland

This repository captures the human knowledge of the topic "Complexity Theory" in a shorthand way.

This repository is not a course in complexity theory and its content will assume full knowledge of first degree in computer science. Â 
In essence, this repository is for people with math or computer science background.

If you know a significant Computation Module, Class or Language, you should and can contribute to this project! For more information please read the [Contrebution rules](#Contrebution%20rules).

  <summary><h1>Project structure</h1></summary>

## Tree hierarchy (not to be confused with the polynomial hierarchy)

The project has a clear file hierarchy you can use for navigation, most of the files in the main page are for the website.
The data files with all the information about the classes and modules are located in the [Storage folder](./Storage).

## File convention

Inside the files you will find the actual information, We strongly recommend you stick to those rules,

1. We aim to make all files written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.
2. All files should start with [Jekyll front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), the 
```markdown
---
layout: page
title: {The title to be used in the tab name}
displayTitle: {Optional, The title for the page itself}
---
```
3. All mentions of another module/class/language should include a link to that file or the Wikipedia page.

The **Typing Convention** is as follows, the files should include the following sub-headings (h2),

1. _Definition_: A formal definition of the subject.
2. _Theorems_: Important theorems about the subject.
3. _Languages_: Complete languages for the class/subject.

If you don't know what to write in one of the sub-headings please leave it with ellipsis (...) so the next reader will know it needs completion and might even contribute on top of you!
